  * Brought parts of the code so we could get to coding the 
    beginning; kind of the "introduction" to the website

  * Started to code and before doing so we decided on what
    we wanted published based off our idea of how the website
    would look
    
   * Adem started to code .css file for the style and editorial 
     of the webpage and Abdoulaye and I (Albert Linares) started
     to code HTML/PHP file to displayh webpage.

  * We continued to code from where we left off last week
    but we had some new proposals
    
  * We are currently deciding whether we want to let users
    upload content about their business/companies or would 
    we rather let them email us and then let us publish it 
    for them (that way we keep a professional website by 
    maintaining control.)
    
   * Adem coding .css file, Abdoulaye and I (Albert Linares)

Time: 1 hours and 4 minutes

   * We decided that we want the users to email us (our support
     team) that way we maintain control of what gets posted and we 
     don't allow somebody to upload a malicious file. More for security
     reasons.
     
   * Abdoulaye and I (Albert) gathered samples from businesses and published
     them on the website 
     
   * Adem went ahead and styled the "Publish" Section and presented it exactly 
     how we saw it in our heads.
