  * Brought parts of the code so we could get to coding the 
    beginning; kind of the "introduction" to the website

  * Started to code and before doing so we decided on what
    we wanted published based off our idea of how the website
    would look

  * We continued to code from where we left off last week
    but we had some new proposals
    
  * We are currently deciding whether we want to let users
    upload content about their business/companies or would 
    we rather let them email us and then let us publish it 
    for them (that way we keep a professional website by 
    maintaining control.
